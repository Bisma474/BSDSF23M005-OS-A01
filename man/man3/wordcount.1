.TH WORDCOUNT 3 "2025-09-23" "libmyutils" "Library Functions"
.SH NAME
wordCount \- count lines, words, and characters in a file stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "myfilefunctions.h"

int wordCount(FILE *file, int *lines, int *words, int *chars);
.SH DESCRIPTION
wordCount reads from the provided file stream and counts the number of lines, words,
and characters.

The count values are stored in the integer locations pointed to by lines, words, and chars
(if non-NULL). Words are sequences of non-whitespace characters delimited by whitespace.
The function does not rewind the stream before or after; the caller should position the
stream as needed.

Return value: 0 on success, -1 on failure (for example if file is NULL or an I/O error occurs).
.SH EXAMPLE
.B
int l,w,c;
FILE *f = fopen("input.txt", "r");
if (f) {
    if (wordCount(f, &l, &w, &c) == 0) {
        printf("%d lines, %d words, %d chars\n", l, w, c);
    }
    fclose(f);
}
